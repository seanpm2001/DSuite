## Inspired by

- [`proton.me`](https://proton.me/) - Major inspiration for DCal and DCalender, although did not serve as inspiration for DMail in the beginning
- - [`calendar.proton.me`](https://calendar.proton.me/) - For increasing my interest in digital calendars and spurring the development of DCal/DCalendar
- [`The word "Digital"`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) - Inspired the naming of the projects (The **D** in **D**Suite projects always stands for Digital)
- [`GSuite`](https://web.archive.org/web/20201007003621/https://workspace.google.com/) - Partially for the naming scheme

- CSS

Language neutrality is in order. When projects start using other languages (say JavaScript) there will be alternative implementations in place in PHP, Ruby, and other languages for each project. There must be at least 3 choices for alternative languages that are widely accepted.
