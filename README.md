## Inspired by

- [`proton.me`](https://proton.me/) - Major inspiration for DCal and DCalender, although did not serve as inspiration for DMail in the beginning
- - [`calendar.proton.me`](https://calendar.proton.me/) - For increasing my interest in digital calendars and spurring the development of DCal/DCalendar
- [`The word "Digital"`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_electronics) - Inspired the naming of the projects (The **D** in **D**Suite projects always stands for Digital)
- [`GSuite`](https://web.archive.org/web/20201007003621/https://workspace.google.com/) - Partially for the naming scheme
